# Meet App
This project demonstrates how to create a progressive web application (PWA)
using a Google Calender API to fetch upcoming events. 

## Key Features
Key features, user stories, and scenarios used for this application are the following:

### FEATURE 1: FILTER EVENTS BY CITY
**User Story:** As a user, I would like to be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events that
take place in that city.

* Scenario 1: When user hasn’t searched for a city, show upcoming events from all cities.
* Scenario 2: User should see a list of suggestions when they search for a city.
* Scenario 3: User can select a city from the suggested list.

### FEATURE 2: SHOW/HIDE AN EVENT'S DETAILS
**User Story:** As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less
information about an event.

* Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default
* Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see its details
* Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide its details

### FEATURE 3: SPECIFY NUMBER OF EVENTS
**User Story:** As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so
that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.

* Scenario 1: When user hasn’t specified a number, 32 is the default number
* Scenario 2: User can change the number of events they want to see

### FEATURE 4: USE THE APP WHEN OFFLINE
**User Story:** As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I
viewed the last time I was online.

* Scenario 1: Show cached data when there’s no internet connection
* Scenario 2: Show error when user changes the settings (city, time range)

### FEATURE 5: DATA VISUALIZATION
**User Story:** As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so
that I know what events are organized in which city.

* Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city
